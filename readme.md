This is a repository for applications made in CSE 4253 - Programming in 
C#

I will be adding .NET and .NETCore personal projects here as well and 
expanding adding functionality to the ones listed above.

So far,
RPG Core is a simple Console Applcation for testing the combat system 
showcased in RPG Simulator

RPG Simulator is a WPF app which utilizes a GUI to show the results of a 
simple RPG (Final Fantasy esque) battle simulation

Report List is a WinForms app which allows users to organize reports. It 
was made for the purpose of research, so students could organize 
papers/reports/articles being used as research resources in a concise 
manner which can be easily cited.

I will be adding Automatic Citation algorithms to Report List soon (cite 
listed sources in MLA, ALA, etc.)

Each project will have a ReadMe to list individual specifications!
